# Vehicle Theft & Car Prowl most likely to occur at night during summer months in Seattle

Using the Seattle Summer 2014 dataset, I wanted to investigate the times that crimes were committed to hopefully uncover patterns, such as particular crimes being more likely to be committed in the day or at night.

Firstly, I decided to focus on the top 10 most reported crimes. I subsetted the data so that it only contained the following reported crimes.

| Crime             | Numer of reported incidents |
--------------------|------|
| CAR PROWL         | 6230 |
| OTHER PROPERTY    | 3755 |
| BURGLARY          | 3212 |
| VECHICLE THEFT    | 3057 |
| PROPERTY DAMAGE   | 2365 |
| ASSAULT           | 2018 |
| FRAUD             | 1473 |
| DISTRURBANCE      | 1333 |
| THREATS           | 1178 |
| STOLEN PROPERTY   | 1136 |
